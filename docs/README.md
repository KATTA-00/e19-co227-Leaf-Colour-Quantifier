## Introduction

Welcome to <em>"LeafSpectrum"</em>, a cutting-edge mobile application designed to revolutionize the way we perceive and understand the world of plants. LeafSpectrum is your trusted companion in the realm of leaf color analysis, offering a seamless and elegant solution for plant enthusiasts, researchers, and botanists alike.

## Challenges With Traditional Method

Traditional methods of leaf color assessment have long relied on subjective human judgment and manual color matching, resulting in inconsistencies and subjectivity in scientific studies and plant identification.
<em>LeafSpectrum</em> addresses this critical need for a reliable, objective, and time-efficient leaf color assessment technique.
