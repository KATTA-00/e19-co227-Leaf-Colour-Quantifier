## Introduction

 Welcome to our GitHub repository for a project on developing a simple field technique to detect and quantify the color of plant leaves. Our goal is to provide a practical solution for researchers, botanists, and enthusiasts who need a quick and accurate method to assess leaf color in various environments.
Traditionally, leaf color assessment has been subjective and time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we are developing a field technique that leverages computer vision and image processing. By capturing leaf images and analyzing the RGB values or other color models, we can quantify the color characteristics of the leaves, such as hue, saturation, and brightness.
Our approach is simple, affordable, and accessible, using commonly available equipment and open-source software libraries. The use of digital imaging ensures consistent and repeatable measurements, reducing human bias.
